In 2020 Spring, I started working on another interesting interdisciplinary project with an undergraduate student Giovanna Turong (BA, Yale, '23) to extend our applications on levitated drops.

The goal of this project is using a magnetically levitated water drop to reveal the an experimentally undiscovered phase transition in supercooled water. Check the following nice introductory articles: 1. [Supercooled water goes supercritical](https://physicstoday.scitation.org/do/10.1063/pt.6.1.20180822a/full/), 2. [The war over supercooled water](https://physicstoday.scitation.org/do/10.1063/pt.6.1.20180822a/full/).

A magnetically levitated water drop could overcome liquid-solid surface contacting nucleation, which is crucial to keep water in the liquid phase in low temperature. Measuring water drops' acoustic modes, such as surface modes, breathing modes, will provide an accurate access to mechanical properties of supercooled water, which in turn indicates the water phase transition.
