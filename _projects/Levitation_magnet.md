Since 2023 August, I have joined the NVs-mechanics project with graduate students Frankie Fung (BA, UChicago ‘19), DaLi Schaefer (BA, UMich ‘19) and Trisha Madhavan (BA, Princeton '21).

Interfacing spins and mechanical degrees of freedom allows for a variety of applications and experimental observations. For example, one can deterministically entangle pairs of spins through their coherent coupling with the dynamics of a resonator, even for large spin-spin distance separations and thermal resonator states. Additionally, the resonator could be cooled close to the quantum ground state by bringing a strongly coupled bath of spins into resonance, introducing the possibility of single phonon experiments and quantum state preparation of a mesoscopic object.
