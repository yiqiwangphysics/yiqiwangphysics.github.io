  title={Measuring High Order&#8211;Phonon Correlations in an Optomechanical Resonator},
  abstract={We use single photon detectors to probe the motional state of a superfluid 4&#8211;Helium resonator of mass around 1 ng. The arrival times of Stokes and anti&#8211;Stokes photons (scattered by the resonator&#180;s acoustic mode) are used to measure the resonator&#180;s phonon coherences up to the fourth order. By postselecting on photon detection events, we also measure coherences in the resonator when less than 3 phonons have been added or subtracted. These measurements are found to be consistent with predictions that assume the acoustic mode to be in thermal equilibrium with a bath through a Markovian coupling.},
