  journal = {arXiv},
  abstract={The electron bubble in superfluid helium has two degrees of freedom that may offer exceptionally low dissipation:the electron’s spin and the bubble’s motion. If these degrees of freedom can be read out and controlled with sufficient sensitivity, they would provide a novel platform for realizing a range of quantum
technologies and for exploring open questions in the physics of superfluid helium. Here we propose a practical scheme for accomplishing this by trapping an electron bubble inside a superfluid-filled opto-acoustic cavity.},

  title = {Superfluid Helium Drops Levitated in High Vacuum},
  abstract={We demonstrate the trapping of millimeter-scale superfluid helium drops in high vacuum. The drops are sufficiently isolated that they remain trapped indefinitely, cool by evaporation to 330 mK, and exhibit mechanical damping that is limited by internal processes. The drops are also shown to host optical whispering gallery modes. The approach described here combines the advantages of multiple techniques, and should offer access to new experimental regimes of cold chemistry, superfluid physics, and optomechanics.},

  title={Measuring High-Order Phonon Correlations in an Optomechanical Resonator},
  abstract={We use single photon detectors to probe the motional state of a superfluid 4-Helium resonator of mass around 1 ng. The arrival times of Stokes and anti-Stokes photons (scattered by the resonator's acoustic mode) are used to measure the resonator's phonon coherences up to the fourth order. By postselecting on photon detection events, we also measure coherences in the resonator when less than 3 phonons have been added or subtracted. These measurements are found to be consistent with predictions that assume the acoustic mode to be in thermal equilibrium with a bath through a Markovian coupling.},
