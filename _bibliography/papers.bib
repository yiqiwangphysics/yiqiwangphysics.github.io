  title={Measuring High-Order Phonon Correlations in an Optomechanical Resonator},
  abstract={We use single photon detectors to probe the motional state of a superfluid 4-Helium resonator of mass around 1 ng. The arrival times of Stokes and anti-Stokes photons (scattered by the resonator's acoustic mode) are used to measure the resonator's phonon coherences up to the fourth order. By postselecting on photon detection events, we also measure coherences in the resonator when less than 3 phonons have been added or subtracted. These measurements are found to be consistent with predictions that assume the acoustic mode to be in thermal equilibrium with a bath through a Markovian coupling.},

  title= {Characterization of Levitated Superfluid Helium Drops in High Vacuum},
  abstract={We describe measurements of the thermal, mechanical, and optical properties of drops of superfluid 4He that are magnetically levitated in high vacuum. The drops have radius &#8764;200 Î¼m, cool by evaporation to temperatures &#8764;300 mK, and can be trapped indefinitely in a background vapor pressure &#8764;10^{-8} mBar. Measurements of the drops' evaporation rate, normal modes of motion, and optical whispering gallery modes are found to agree with well-established models.},
