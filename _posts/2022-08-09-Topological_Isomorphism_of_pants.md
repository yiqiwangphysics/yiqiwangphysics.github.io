Finished a dayâ€™s work, walking along HillHouse Ave, I am touched by the soft breeze in summer sunset. Starting with a random question by me: "How many holes are there in pants?", we are divided into two groups with answers 2 and 3, respectively.
The argument from me that the pants have three holes is that: Imagine that blow you pants into a ballon, and the hole on your waist and two holes for two legs will appear on that $$S^2$$ sphere surface. All of them together count three holes.

Another argument states pants is topologically equivalent to a Thong underwear, which is indeed a [genus-2 surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus_%28mathematics%29)!

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <center>
        {% include figure.html path="/assets/img/posts_img/Thong_underwear.png" height="200" %}
        <div class="caption">
          A Thong Underwear
        </div>
        </center>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <center>
        {% include figure.html path="/assets/img/posts_img/Genus-2 surface.jpg" height="200" %}
        <div class="caption">
             A Genus-2 Surface
        </div>
        </center>
    </div>
</div>

After some thoughts, the shortcut to bridge the gap between these two arguments is expand one of the holes in $$S^2$$ to infinity and it ends up with a Thong underwear shape geometry. This intriguing thought leads me to dig a bit more deeper in the definition of the holes.
