I attended International Conference on Atomic Physics (ICAP 2022) in Toronto from July 17th to July 23rd and gave a [poster presentation](https://conference.physics.utoronto.ca/event/1/contributions/116/) in University of Toronto. The abstract is given below:

#### Abstract:

>Macroscopic mechanical devices in the quantum regime can play a key role in quantum communication, quantum sensing and fundamental tests of quantum mechanics. We use a fiber cavity filled with superfluid 4He of mass ~ 1 ng as our mechanical resonator. Leveraging single photon counting techniques, we manipulate and probe the motional state of a superfluid 4He resonator. The arrival times of Stokes and anti-Stokes photons are used to measure the resonatorâ€™s phonon coherences. We demonstrate the coherences of a thermal state near the motional ground state, a non-classical photon-phonon squeezed state, and a high amplitude coherent state in this superfluid 4He resonator. These measurements pave the avenue of realizing a non-classical state in a milligram resonator in future experiments.

Had lots of fun in the conference and enjoyed foods in Toronto.
Look forward to ICAP 2024 in London.
