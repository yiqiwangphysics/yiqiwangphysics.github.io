It is my great pleasure to be invited to attend [Harvard Quantum Initiative](https://quantum.harvard.edu) QuantumFest. I presented my graduate research work with title:
> Manipulating and Measuring States of an Optomechanical Resonator in the Quantum regime

Very insightful questions and very engaged discussions from world best talents.
