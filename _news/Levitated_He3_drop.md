We are the first team levitated 3He on the earth!
The levitation between 3He and 4He liquid are very similar except for the following difference:
- In the temperature we are operating, 4He is superfluid, but 3He is normal fluid.
- 3He has net nuclear spin, therefor, is slightly paramagnetic contributed from its nucleus. And the net magnetic susceptibility is temperature dependent.

<div class="row mt-6">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="/news/news_img/He3Drop.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>

Will try to levitate it in even lower temperature and in vacuum!
