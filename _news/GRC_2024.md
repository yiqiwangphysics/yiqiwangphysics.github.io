[GRC](https://www.grc.org/mechanical-systems-in-the-quantum-regime-conference/2024/) is always my favorator conference. Meet lots of new and old friends there and, of course, learned lots of cutting-edge scientific breakthroughs. 

Sunshine, beach, science and discussions are perfectly mixed in a five-day stay.
