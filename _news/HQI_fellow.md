I will join Harvard as a [Harvard Quantum Initiative Prize Postdoctoral Fellow](https://quantum.harvard.edu/post-doctoral-fellows) working with [Prof. Mikhail Lukin](https://lukin.physics.harvard.edu/people/mikhail-lukin) starting from this summer, 2023. I am thrilled to embark on a captivating new adventure!

Excited to see everyone in Cambridge this summer!
