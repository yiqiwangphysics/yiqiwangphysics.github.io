"[Superfluid Helium Drops Levitated in High Vacuum](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.130.216001)" is published on Phys.Rev.Lett.! and selected as Editor's Suggestion!

This paper is about my first three years work at Yale on a levitated helium drop experiment.

Thanks for a nice write up in [New Scientist](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2377034-extremely-cold-drop-of-helium-can-be-levitated-forever/)!
