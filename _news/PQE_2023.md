I attended [PQE-2023](https://pqeconference.firebaseapp.com) (The 53rd Winter Colloquium on the Physics of Quantum Electronics) in Snowbird from Jan 8th to Jan 13th.

Lots of very impressive talks and had a chance to meet my undergraduate QM2 teacher, Renbao Liu, again for many years.
Insightful discussions on Science, together with unforgettable skiing experience!
