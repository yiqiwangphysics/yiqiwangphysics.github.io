I am a sixth year [Applied Physics Department](https://appliedphysics.yale.edu/) PhD student from **[AT]** Yale University. In January 2018, I started working with [Prof. Jack Harris](https://physics.yale.edu/people/jack-harris) on Optomechanics in quantum regime. More specifically, I focused on studying

Prior my PhD, I hold a B.S. (2017) in Physics, with Honors, from [Department of Physics, Fudan University](https://phys.fudan.edu.cn/eng/), where my research focused on the condensed matter experiments in low temperature and high magnetic fields.

I was born on a small island, Luxi(鹿西) island, in SouthEast China, where I spent all my first 13 years. Since then, all cities (Wenzhou, Shanghai, Hong Kong, New Haven) I have stayed are near the coast. I enjoy swimming, basketball and hiking. I also learnt skiing in new England. I have a cat (NOT a superposition BUT alive) named Chowder.
