**I** am an HQI postdoctoral fellow at [Harvard Physics Department](https://www.physics.harvard.edu) and [Harvard Quantum Initiative](https://quantum.harvard.edu).
In August 2023, I started working with [Prof. Mikhail Lukin](https://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/lukin) on [coupling NVs to mechanical resonators](https://lukin.physics.harvard.edu/coupling-nvs-mechanical-resonators). The aim is to explore the interface between spins (NVs) and mechanical degrees of freedom for potential quantum applications.
<!--
allows for a variety of applications and experimental observations. For example, one can deterministically entangle pairs of spins through their coherent coupling with the dynamics of a resonator, even for large spin-spin distance separations and thermal resonator states. Additionally, the resonator could be cooled close to the quantum ground state by bringing a strongly coupled bath of spins into resonance, introducing the possibility of single phonon experiments and quantum state preparation of a mesoscopic object. -->

**P**rior to my postdoc, I obtained my Ph.D. from Yale University in August 2023. During my Ph.D., I was working with [Prof. Jack Harris](https://physics.yale.edu/people/jack-harris) on quantum optomechanics. My work focused on: i) [`Building an optical cavity filled with superfluid Helium`](/projects/phonon); ii) [`Magnetically levitating a Helium drop`](/projects/levitated). These experiments opened the new possibilities to quantum sensing, quantum communication, and fundamental physics tests.
<!-- **I** am a sixth-year [Applied Physics](https://appliedphysics.yale.edu/) Ph.D. student from Yale University. In January 2018, I started working with [Prof. Jack Harris](https://physics.yale.edu/people/jack-harris) on Optomechanics in the quantum regime. More specifically, we are using optics to manipulate and measure the motional state of a massive oscillator near its zero-point motion. Here, my work focuses on: i) [`Building an optical cavity filled with superfluid Helium`](/projects/phonon); ii) [`Magnetically levitating a Helium drop`](/projects/levitated). These experiments aim to bridge the gap between macroscopicity and quantum phenomena. This intriguing overlap leads to versatile applications, such as quantum sensing, quantum communication ,and fundamental physics tests. -->

I hold a B.Sc. (2017) in Physics, with Honors, from [Department of Physics, Fudan University](https://phys.fudan.edu.cn/eng/), where my research focused on condensed matter experiments in low temperature and high magnetic fields.

**I** was born on a small island, [Luxi(鹿西) island](../assets/img/Luxi.jpeg), in SouthEast China, where I spent my first 13 years. Since then, all cities (Wenzhou, Shanghai, Hong Kong, New Haven, Boston) I have been living in are near the coast. I enjoy swimming, basketball, and hiking. I also learned [skiing](../assets/img/Ski.jpeg) in New England and leart [sailing](../assets/img/sail.jpeg) on Charles river. I have a Cat (**NOT** in a Superposition state **BUT** Alive) named [Chowder](../assets/img/Chowder.jpeg).
