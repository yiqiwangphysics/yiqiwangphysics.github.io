**I** am a sixth year [Applied Physics](https://appliedphysics.yale.edu/) PhD student from Yale University. In January 2018, I started working with [Prof. Jack Harris](https://physics.yale.edu/people/jack-harris) on Optomechanics in quantum regime. More specifically, I focused on studying

**P**rior my PhD, I hold a B.S. (2017) in Physics, with Honors, from [Department of Physics, Fudan University](https://phys.fudan.edu.cn/eng/), where my research focused on the condensed matter experiments in low temperature and high magnetic fields.

**I** was born at a small island, [Luxi(鹿西) island](/assets/img/prof_pic), in SouthEast China, where I spent all my first 13 years. Since then, all cities (Wenzhou, Shanghai, Hong Kong, New Haven) I have lived in are near the coast. I enjoy swimming, basketball and hiking. I also learnt skiing in New England. I have a 'Cat' (**NOT** at Superposition **BUT** Alive) named Chowder.
